    	<p>Generally speaking, freshwater fish are less expensive and easier to care for than other types of pets, leading to the perception that they’re easy to keep. While they can be less trouble than other types of animals, that doesn’t exactly make them low-maintenance pets.
    	Fish have the same basic needs as other animals, including food, water and a proper habitat, but because fish live in completely different environments than humans and other mammals, they are dependent on us to provide everything they need to live happily.</p>

	    	<h2>What are the Most Common Types of Pet Fish?</h2>
	    	<p>The most popular types of pet fish include betta fish (also known as Siamese fighting fish), common goldfish, Achilles tang, fantail goldfish, and angelfish. Part of the reason why goldfish and bettas are so popular is because they can live in water temperatures that don’t always require heaters (depending on where you live), can tolerate some variation in water chemistry compared to other fish, are generally healthy eaters and are hardier than other fish.</p>

	    	<h2>How Often Do Fish Need to be Fed?</h2>
	    	<p>Fish don’t have stomachs, so they never know when to stop eating. When feeding your fish, only feed it as much as it will eat in two or three minutes once or twice per day. Some types of fish, like goldfish, should only be fed as much as they can eat in one minute, while other types have different requirements. Overfeeding is one of the most common mistakes fish owners make.Goldfish are especially easygoing and can survive up to two weeks without food</p>

    	<h3>Where is the Best Place to Buy a Fish?</h3>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Pangolin', cursive;">It depends what type of fish you’re looking to buy, but pet stores typically have wide selections of fish. Aquarium stores have employees well-trained in educating new fish owners and can make sure you select the right fish and equipment. Another option is to seek out a fish breeder for more specialized types or specific colors of fish. Many popular types of pet fish are commercially bred, and most pet stores get their fish from commercial breeders.</p>

	    	<h2>How Often do Fish Tanks Need to be Cleaned?</h2>
	    	<p>Aquariums require regular water changes and pH testing in order to ensure fish are living in the proper conditions. Depending on the size of the aquarium and filtration system you have set up, you’ll need to perform weekly partial water replacement, as well as clean the tank and change the water about once per month.
	        Some fish, like goldfish, are known for being extra messy and may require more frequent water changes and tank cleanings. Overfeeding will also quickly pollute water. Monitoring the pH levels of your aquarium and keeping an eye on any visible contaminants and pollutants should give you a good idea as to how often you’ll need to clean your fish tank.</p>

	    	<ul>
	    		<li>The size of the aquarium will depend on how many fish you have and how big they will be as adults.</li>
	            <li>The aquarium should be near a power source in a low-traffic area, away from direct sunlight and drafts.</li>
	            <li>Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Pick a very sturdy, stable base for the aquarium before filling it.</li>

    	<h3>Healthy Aquarium Water</h3>
    	<h1>Fish need clean, chemically balanced water to thrive.</h1><br>

        <p>An aquarium is a delicately balanced ecosystem that relies on “good” bacteria to keep fish healthy. When everything is working right, helpful bacteria grow in the aquarium’s gravel and filter. There, they help break down the ammonia and nitrite found in fish waste—which, if left unchecked, would be toxic to your fish.
        When you first set up your aquarium, you’ll need to encourage the growth of these beneficial bacteria. The process, called cycling, can take 4 to 6 weeks. Using bacteria starters can reduce the cycling time to 1 to 3 weeks.</p>
