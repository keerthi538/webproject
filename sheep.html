	          	Sheep with its multi-facet utility for wool, meat, milk, skins and manure, form an important component of rural economy particularly in the arid, semi-arid and mountainous areas of the country. It provides a dependable source of income to the shepherds through sale of wool and animals.

        	<p>Sheep are grazing mammals often kept as livestock on farms. Sheep can be used for meat, wool and milk. Sheep generally have a lifespan of 6 to 14 years. When well cared for, sheep can live up to 20 years. Sheep are adaptable to many climates and can be found throughout the world. There are over 200 breeds of sheep, each of which thrive under particular conditions. If you plan to purchase sheep, you will need to purchase a breed appropriate for your geography and living conditions. You will also need to know how to care for sheep.</p>

     	<h3 style="font-family: 'Wallpoet', cursive;line-height: 50px;">part 1:<br>Providing the right environment</h3>
     	<div class="hspace"></div>
     	<div>
	     	<ol>
	     		<li>
	     			Provide year-round shelter. Your sheep need a shelter that protects them from all the elements, year round. These elements include sun, wind, and rain. While a barn is a great, it's not necessary. A three-sided structure works just as well
	     			
	     			<ul>
	     				<li>The nice thing about having a barn with stalls is that you can separate sick or pregnant sheep from the rest of the flock.</li>
	     				<li>A shaded area outside is a good idea, so that the sheep can be outside in the warm weather, but have somewhere cool to graze. This could be anything from an overhang off the barn, or a clump of trees.</li>
	     			</ul>
	     		</li>
	     		<li>Give them straw bedding. How much bedding you have should depend on how much time the sheep spend in their shelter. For colder climates it's best to give them a good, thick bedding of hay. This will keep them clean and warm.
                    <ul>
	     				<li>You shouldn't use sawdust for wool sheep as this will ruin their wool.</li>
	     				<li>Some people consider pine shavings to be better than hay, because of its absorbency, but that simply depends on your personal preference. Pine shavings do cling to a sheep's coat, which can make it more difficult come shearing time.</li>
	     				<li>You can sprinkle PDZ in each stall and under the overhang outside about once a month to neutralize urine.</li>
	     			</ul>

	     		</li>
	     		<li>Make sure that your pasture supports the number of sheep you choose. Sheep will spend about 7 hours a day grazing. Most estimates are about 10 sheep per acre. The number can vary based on size and condition of sheep (ewes with lambs), condition of pasture (tall fescue grows fast spring and fall), and how you manage your pasture.

                    <ul>
	     				<li>Pasture sizes vary based on locale, climate, maintenance, type of planting, and rainfall. For example: dry rocky conditions will need more pastureland to provide more grass.</li>
	     			</ul>

	     		</li>
	     		<li>Keep the airflow moving. Install a fan, and keep the doors to the shelter open. This is especially important if you live in a hotter climate, or have hot summers. There should be airflow all throughout the year, even in the cooler times, although you don't necessarily want to have the fan going in winter.
                    <ul>
	     				<li>A fan and open doors will cool the shelter on hot days, as well as keep the flies away from the sheep.</li>
	     				
	     			</ul>
	     		</li>

	     		<li>Set up fencing. Fencing is incredibly important for keeping the sheep in and the predators out. A five foot (1.5 m) tall fence should be enough to keep the sheep in the pasture. Higher fences are needed to keep predators out.
                    <ul>
	     				<li>Make sure you have portable panels to enclose sick sheep, especially if you're also got stalls. You'll need to keep them away from the healthy sheep.</li>
	     				<li>You can also electrify your fence. Even with a tall seven foot (2 m) tall fence, predators can dig under the fence and attack your sheep. Electrifying your fence will deter predators as soon as they touch the fence. Don't count on it keeping your sheep in, though. With heavy coats, sheep are less likely to feel the bolts of electricity.</li>

     	<h3 style="font-family: 'Wallpoet', cursive;line-height: 50px;">part 2:<br>Feeding your sheep</h3>
     	<div class="hspace"></div>
     	<div>
	     	<ol>
	     		<li>
	     			Have pasture or hay make up most of their diet. Sheep naturally eat pasture plants such as grass and clover. If the pasture is large enough and stays in bloom all year, you do not need to provide supplemental food for the sheep.
	     			
	     			<ul>
	     				<li>The amount of hay needed will depend on the quality of the hay, use of pasture, condition  of sheep (pregnant ewes, or with lambs) and amount of grain being feed. A reasonable estimate for feeding strictly hay is about 3.5 percent body weight per day.</li>
	     				<li>Hay is basically cut, dried, and baled forage. It tends to be a grass or legume (like alfalfa or clover). The later the cutting the better the feed quality of the hay, typically..</li>
	     				<li>Alfalfa and clover hays tend to be more nutritious and preferred by most animals. They are more expensive, though, and aren’t imperative for sheep.</li>
	     				<li>Keep in mind that some clovers may contain a substance similar to estrogen which can work as birth-control in sheep, so avoid that if you’re trying to breed your ewes.</li>
	     			</ul>
	     		</li>
	     		<li>Avoid over-feeding your sheep grain. Grain isn't actually that great for sheep, except in a few specific cases, because these mixes tend to contain too much copper for a sheep's diet. If you do need to supplement your sheep's diet with grain try to get a mix that is specially formulated for sheep.
                    <ul>
	     				<li>Eating too much grain can also cause your sheep to bloat, and potentially die. So really avoid over-feeding grain.</li>
	     				<li>A basic mix with corn/soy/oats, or specially formulated sheep/goat chow from your local feed mill should work if they need a little extra supplement. Ones that may need some grain added to their diet typically are young, lactating, or elderly sheep.</li>
	     				<li>Goat or cow mixes are better than horse mixes if you can’t find one that is formulated specially for sheep. Again, sheep are sensitive to copper, so avoid all-purpose mixes.</li>
	     			</ul>

	     		</li>
	     		<li>Store food. Hay should be dry before being stored, kept out the rain, and off the ground. If hay gets damp it can be dried again and used for bedding; though care needs to be taken to prevent sheep from eating molded hay. Grain should be stored in metal containers with lids to prevent damage from rodents. 
     
	     		</li>

	     		<li>Make sure your sheep have access to salt. Sheep need the minerals that come with salt. Make sure that you're getting minerals that are specially made for goats, because while they need copper too much copper can make them ill or kill them.
                    <ul>
	     				<li>Salt blocks can be good, but they also don't last all that long and might not get enough minerals just from licking it.</li>
	     				<li>Loose mineral salt tends to be less expensive than salt blocks and you can place it in a feeder in the shelter.</li>
	     				
	     			</ul>
	     		</li>

	     		<li>Provide them with fresh, clean water. Sheep need access to fresh, clean water. Sheep will consume a couple gallons of water each day, and more when it is hot and it needs to be clean (free of algae and so on)..
                    <ul>
	     				<li>You can use an automatic waterer if you don't want to have to carry a bunch of buckets every day. The tub automatically fills when the animals drink. All you have to do is scrub it clean once a week.</li>
	     				
	     			</ul>

	     		</li>
	     	</ol>
