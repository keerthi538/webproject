   	 	<p>Dogs share our lives in a way that most other animals can't, 
   	 	 and they're so commonplace that it's easy to take their faithful 
   	     companionship for granted. The purpose of this article is to remind
   	 	 us of why we love dogs so much, to spare a few minutes and to spare 
   	 	 a few words in praise of "man's best friend," the dog.
         Dogs are friendly and they love human companionship. Whose ego would not be gratified at the
          sight of a happy dog who can't wait to greet you at the end of a hard day ?<br> <a href="dog.html">Learn more</a></p>

   	 	<p> We respect, honour and adore the cow.
   	 	 By honouring this gentle animal, who gives more than she takes, we honour all creatures.
         Hindus regard all living creatures as sacred – mammals, fishes, birds and more. 
         We acknowledge this reverence for life in our special affection for the cow. At 
         festivals we decorate and honour her, but we do not worship her in the sense that we worship the Deity
          It gives and gives and gives of its milk, as does the liberated soul give of his spiritual knowledge

   	 	<p>"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."
   	 		A fish is an amazing animal which lives and breathes in water. Fish have been on the Earth for over 500 million years
   	 		Fish make up about half of all known vertebrate species. Fish have been on the earth for more than 500 million years. Fish were well established long before dinosaurs roamed the earth.
   	 		Fish have excellent senses of sight, touch, taste and many possess a good sense of smell and ‘hearing’.

   	 	<p>There’s no question that cats are a popular choice for pets — in fact, according to 
   	 		the American Veterinary Medical Association, about 25 percent of U.S. households have
   	 		 these cute, furry felines as a live-in friend. Sure, they're mischievous at times, 
   	 		 and they might love to lay across your keyboard while you're working or enjoy 
   	 		 smacking things off your desk for no particular reason, but if you ask us, that's
   	 		  entirely part of their charm — and a big reason why we love them so much.
