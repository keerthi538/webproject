        <h2>Understand your cat’s language to better understand your cat.</h2><br><br>
        <h3>Did you know that cats meow to people, but not to other cats?</h3>
        <p>
            Adult cats, living apart from humans, have very clear communication with one another. Cat language is spokenmostly through scent, then through facial expression, complex body language and touch.<br><br>

            Cat sounds for vocal communication involve caterwauls for mating, chattering upon spotting prey, hissing to ward off an intruder or shrieking when hurt or terrified. Meowing is not part of natural cat language—it was developed almost exclusively for humans.<br><br>

            The only meowing in cat language is done between a mother cat and her kittens. A kitten’s tiny “mew” is a cute, endearing sound, used to solicit attention and care from mom cat. Once the kittens are grown, the mews and meows would stop, if not for communicating with humans.<br><br>

            So why do cats meow to people? Because meowing is what works. Your cat is dependent on you and quickly learns that you are clearly not picking up the scent messages she leaves on your belongings or the body language she is attempting to use.<br><br>

            The meows and mews are what get you to do what she wants. So the meowing develops into a second language to communicate to you.<br><br>

            Some scientists would go so far as to say that cats have refined their meows specifically to manipulate people. And we have to admit—it works!<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Different meow different meanings!!</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Short meow or mew: Standard greeting. “Hello!”</li><br>
                <li>Multiple meows or mews: Excited greeting. “Great to see you!”</li><br>
                <li>Mid-pitch meow: Plea for something. “I’d like to eat.”</li><br>
                <li>Drawn-out mrrroooow: Demand for something. “Open the door. NOW.”</li><br>
                <li>Low-pitch MRRRooooowww: Complaint of a wrong you have done. “Hey—why’s my bowl still empty?”</li><br>
                <li>High-pitch RRRROWW!: Anger or pain. “That’s my TAIL you just stepped on!”</li><br>

            <p style="width: 370px;">
               Your cat may love canned food as a treat, but should you incorporate it into her daily diet? According to Purina experts, as long as her food is 100 percent complete and balanced, cats can do well on dry or wet food alone.

            <h2 style="max-width: 370px;">Human Food Safe For Cats?</h2><br>
            <p style="width: 370px;">
                Feeding human food to your cat may be tempting, but should not be used as a substitute for a well-balanced, nutritional cat food. Your cat needs a mixture of proteins, grains and nutrients that scraps from the table do not fully provide.

            <p style="width: 370px;">
               You can feed your cat wet food daily. Check the can or consult with your veterinarian for feeding recommendations. In general, you can feed an average-sized adult cat one 3-ounce can per 3 to 3-1/2 pounds of body weight daily.
